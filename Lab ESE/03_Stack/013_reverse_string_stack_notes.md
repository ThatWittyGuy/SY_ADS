Let's break down the code into its blocks and explain each line, followed by an analysis of the result and the time complexity.

### Code Breakdown

#### 1. **Defining Constants and Stack Variables**

```c
#define MAX 100
```
- **Purpose**: This defines a constant `MAX` with a value of 100, which represents the maximum size of the stack (and the maximum length of the string).
  
```c
char stack[MAX];
int top = -1;
```
- **Purpose**: 
  - `stack[MAX]` is an array that will act as the stack. It is used to hold characters temporarily as we process the string.
  - `top = -1` initializes the `top` index of the stack to -1, which means the stack is empty initially.

#### 2. **Push Function**

```c
void push(char c) {
    if (top < MAX - 1) {
        stack[++top] = c;
    }
}
```
- **Purpose**: The `push` function adds a character `c` to the stack.
  - `if (top < MAX - 1)`: This checks whether there is space available in the stack. The stack is full when `top` is equal to `MAX - 1`, so if this condition is true, there is space to push the character.
  - `stack[++top] = c;`: The `top` pointer is incremented, and the character `c` is pushed onto the stack at the new `top` index.

#### 3. **Pop Function**

```c
char pop() {
    if (top >= 0) {
        return stack[top--];
    }
    return -1;
}
```
- **Purpose**: The `pop` function removes and returns the topmost character from the stack.
  - `if (top >= 0)`: This checks if the stack is empty (`top == -1`). If the stack is not empty, it proceeds to pop a character.
  - `return stack[top--];`: The character at the current `top` is returned, and then `top` is decremented, effectively removing the character from the stack.
  - If the stack is empty (`top == -1`), `pop` returns `-1`, which is an invalid value for a character (indicating an error or empty stack).

#### 4. **Reverse String Function**

```c
void reverseString(char *str) {
    int len = strlen(str);
    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        push(str[i]);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        str[i] = pop();
    }
}
```
- **Purpose**: The `reverseString` function reverses the input string `str` using the stack.
  
  - `int len = strlen(str);`: This calculates the length of the string `str` using the `strlen` function from the `string.h` library. It returns the number of characters in the string (excluding the null terminator).
  
  - **Pushing characters onto the stack**:
    ```c
    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        push(str[i]);
    }
    ```
    - This loop iterates over each character in the string `str` and pushes it onto the stack one by one using the `push` function. After this loop, the stack holds the characters in the reverse order of their appearance in the original string.
  
  - **Popping characters from the stack to reverse the string**:
    ```c
    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        str[i] = pop();
    }
    ```
    - This loop pops characters from the stack and places them back into the string `str`. Since the stack holds the characters in reverse order, popping them and placing them into `str` effectively reverses the string.

#### 5. **Main Function**

```c
int main() {
    char str[MAX];

    printf("Enter a string: ");
    scanf("%s", str);

    reverseString(str);

    printf("Reversed string: %s\n", str);

    return 0;
}
```
- **Purpose**: The `main` function handles user input and calls the `reverseString` function to reverse the string, then prints the reversed string.
  
  - `char str[MAX];`: This declares an array `str` to store the string input by the user. The maximum length of the string can be up to `MAX - 1` characters (since we reserve space for the null terminator).
  
  - `printf("Enter a string: ");`: This prints a message asking the user to enter a string.
  
  - `scanf("%s", str);`: This reads a string from the user input and stores it in `str`. The `%s` format specifier reads a word (a sequence of non-space characters) and stops at the first space, so it cannot handle multi-word input correctly.
  
  - `reverseString(str);`: This calls the `reverseString` function, which reverses the string `str` using the stack.
  
  - `printf("Reversed string: %s\n", str);`: This prints the reversed string.

### Example Execution

#### Input:
```
Enter a string: hello
```

#### Output:
```
Reversed string: olleh
```

### Time Complexity Analysis

#### 1. **push Function**:
- Each `push` operation takes **O(1)** time because it just places an element onto the stack and updates the `top` pointer.

#### 2. **pop Function**:
- Each `pop` operation also takes **O(1)** time because it just removes the top element and updates the `top` pointer.

#### 3. **reverseString Function**:
- **Pushing characters onto the stack**: The loop that pushes each character onto the stack iterates `n` times, where `n` is the length of the string. Since each push is **O(1)**, this loop takes **O(n)** time.
  
- **Popping characters from the stack**: Similarly, the loop that pops characters from the stack also iterates `n` times, and each pop is **O(1)**, so this loop also takes **O(n)** time.

- **Overall time complexity of reverseString**: Since both loops are **O(n)**, the total time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string.

#### 4. **Overall Time Complexity**:
- The overall time complexity of the program is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string. This is because the most expensive operation (reversing the string) takes **O(n)** time, and the rest of the operations (input/output) are either constant time or linear in nature.

### Space Complexity

- **Stack space**: The program uses a stack of size `MAX`, so the space complexity for the stack is **O(MAX)**.
- **Input string storage**: The string `str` is stored in an array of size `MAX`. Therefore, the space complexity for storing the string is also **O(MAX)**.

- **Overall space complexity**: The overall space complexity is **O(MAX)**, as the largest space usage comes from the stack and the string storage.

---

### Conclusion:
- This program successfully reverses a string using a stack and handles the input and output efficiently.
- **Time complexity**: **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string.
- **Space complexity**: **O(MAX)**, where `MAX` is the maximum size of the stack and the string.
- The program performs well for moderate input sizes but would need modifications for handling very large strings or strings with spaces.
