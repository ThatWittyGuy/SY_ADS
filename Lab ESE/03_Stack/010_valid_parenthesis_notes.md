Let's go through the code block by block to explain each line of code, followed by an analysis of the result and the time complexity.

### Code Breakdown

#### 1. **Defining Constants and Stack Variables**

```c
#define MAX 100
```
- This defines a constant `MAX` with the value 100. This is used to specify the size of the stack, which will be used to store characters (parentheses in this case).

```c
char stack[MAX];
int top = -1;
```
- `stack[MAX]` defines an array of size 100 to hold the characters. It acts as the stack.
- `top = -1` initializes the `top` variable to -1, which indicates that the stack is empty at the beginning.

#### 2. **Push Function**

```c
void push(char c)
{
    if (top < MAX - 1)
        stack[++top] = c;
}
```
- **Purpose**: The `push` function is used to add a character `c` to the stack.
- `if (top < MAX - 1)` checks if there is space in the stack. The stack is full when `top` equals `MAX - 1`, so this condition ensures that we don't exceed the stack's capacity.
- `stack[++top] = c;` increments the `top` pointer first and then stores the character `c` at the new top position in the stack.

#### 3. **Pop Function**

```c
char pop()
{
    if (top >= 0)
        return stack[top--];
    return -1;
}
```
- **Purpose**: The `pop` function is used to remove and return the topmost character from the stack.
- `if (top >= 0)` checks if the stack is not empty (`top` is -1 when the stack is empty). If the stack is empty, it returns `-1`.
- `return stack[top--];` returns the character at the current `top` position and then decrements the `top` pointer, effectively removing the element from the stack.

#### 4. **isValid Function**

```c
int isValid(char *expr)
{
    for (int i = 0; expr[i] != '\0'; i++)
    {
        char c = expr[i];
        if (c == '(' || c == '{' || c == '[')
            push(c);
        else if (c == ')' || c == '}' || c == ']')
        {
            if (top == -1)
                return 0;
            char topChar = pop();
            if ((c == ')' && topChar != '(') || (c == '}' && topChar != '{') || (c == ']' && topChar != '['))
                return 0;
        }
    }
    return top == -1;
}
```
- **Purpose**: This function checks if the input string of parentheses (or other brackets) is valid. It returns `1` if valid and `0` if invalid.
  
  - `for (int i = 0; expr[i] != '\0'; i++)`: This loop iterates over each character in the input string `expr`.
  
  - `char c = expr[i];`: Stores the current character in `c` for easier reference.
  
  - **Push Operation**:
    ```c
    if (c == '(' || c == '{' || c == '[')
        push(c);
    ```
    - If the current character `c` is an opening bracket (`(`, `{`, `[`), it is pushed onto the stack.
  
  - **Pop and Check for Matching Brackets**:
    ```c
    else if (c == ')' || c == '}' || c == ']')
    {
        if (top == -1)
            return 0;
        char topChar = pop();
        if ((c == ')' && topChar != '(') || (c == '}' && topChar != '{') || (c == ']' && topChar != '['))
            return 0;
    }
    ```
    - If the current character `c` is a closing bracket (`)`, `}`, `]`), the function first checks if the stack is empty (`top == -1`), meaning there is no corresponding opening bracket to match with. If the stack is empty, it returns `0`, indicating invalid parentheses.
    - If the stack is not empty, the function pops the top character of the stack and stores it in `topChar`.
    - It then checks if `topChar` matches the corresponding opening bracket for the current closing bracket `c`. If they don't match, it returns `0`, indicating invalid parentheses.

  - **Final Check**:
    ```c
    return top == -1;
    ```
    - After processing all characters, if the stack is empty (`top == -1`), it means that all opening brackets had a matching closing bracket, and the string is valid. If the stack is not empty, there are unmatched opening brackets, so it returns `0`.

#### 5. **Main Function**

```c
int main()
{
    char expr[MAX];

    printf("Enter a string of parentheses: ");
    scanf("%s", expr);

    if (isValid(expr))
        printf("The parentheses are valid.\n");
    else
        printf("The parentheses are invalid.\n");

    return 0;
}
```
- **Purpose**: The main function gets input from the user and calls the `isValid` function to check if the parentheses in the input string are valid.
  
  - `char expr[MAX];` defines an array `expr` to hold the input string of parentheses.
  
  - `printf("Enter a string of parentheses: ");` prints a prompt asking the user to input a string.
  
  - `scanf("%s", expr);` reads the input string of parentheses and stores it in `expr`.

  - `if (isValid(expr))`: Calls the `isValid` function to check if the string is valid. If valid, it prints `"The parentheses are valid."`, otherwise it prints `"The parentheses are invalid."`.

### Example Execution:

#### Input 1:
```
Enter a string of parentheses: ({[()]})
```
#### Output 1:
```
The parentheses are valid.
```

#### Input 2:
```
Enter a string of parentheses: ([{]})
```
#### Output 2:
```
The parentheses are invalid.
```

### Time Complexity Analysis:

- **isValid Function**:
  - We iterate through each character in the string exactly once.
  - For each character, we either push it onto the stack or pop it from the stack, both of which are O(1) operations.
  - Therefore, the time complexity of the `isValid` function is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string.

- **Overall Complexity**:
  - The `main` function simply calls the `isValid` function, so the overall time complexity of the program is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - We use an array of size `MAX` to implement the stack. So the space complexity is **O(MAX)**, which is a constant space usage based on the stack size defined in the program.

### Conclusion:
- The program uses a stack to validate if a string of parentheses (or other brackets) is balanced.
- It has linear time complexity, making it efficient for checking the validity of parentheses.
