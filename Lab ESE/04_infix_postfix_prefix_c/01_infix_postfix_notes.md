### Code Breakdown and Explanation

#### **Global Variables:**
```c
#define MAX 100
char stack[MAX];
int top = -1;
```
- **MAX:** Defines the maximum size of the stack and other arrays used.
- **stack:** This array will store operators and operands during the conversion from infix to postfix.
- **top:** This integer variable keeps track of the top of the stack. It starts at -1, indicating an empty stack.

---

#### **Push Function:**
```c
void push(char c)
{
    if (top < MAX - 1)
        stack[++top] = c;
}
```
- **Purpose:** Adds an element (operator or operand) to the stack.
- **Working:** If the stack is not full (i.e., `top < MAX - 1`), it increments `top` and assigns the value `c` to the `stack[top]`.

---

#### **Pop Function:**
```c
char pop()
{
    if (top >= 0)
        return stack[top--];
    return -1;
}
```
- **Purpose:** Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
- **Working:** If the stack is not empty (i.e., `top >= 0`), it returns the element at the top of the stack (`stack[top]`) and then decrements `top`. If the stack is empty, it returns `-1` to indicate that there is no element to pop.

---

#### **Precedence Function:**
```c
int precedence(char c)
{
    if (c == '+' || c == '-')
        return 1;
    if (c == '*' || c == '/')
        return 2;
    if (c == '^')
        return 3;
    return 0;
}
```
- **Purpose:** Determines the precedence of operators.
- **Working:** The function returns a numeric value indicating the precedence of the given operator:
  - `+` and `-` have precedence `1`.
  - `*` and `/` have precedence `2`.
  - `^` has precedence `3` (the highest).
- **Why:** Higher precedence operators should be handled before lower precedence ones when converting infix to postfix.

---

#### **IsOperator Function:**
```c
int isOperator(char c)
{
    return (c == '+' || c == '-' || c == '*' || c == '/' || c == '^');
}
```
- **Purpose:** Checks if a character is a valid operator.
- **Working:** The function returns `1` if the character `c` is any of the valid operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`), and `0` otherwise.

---

#### **Infix to Postfix Conversion Function:**
```c
void infixToPostfix(char *infix, char *postfix)
{
    int i = 0, k = 0;
    char c;

    while ((c = infix[i++]) != '\0')
    {
        if (isalnum(c))
        {
            postfix[k++] = c;
        }
        else if (c == '(')
        {
            push(c);
        }
        else if (c == ')')
        {
            while (top != -1 && stack[top] != '(')
                postfix[k++] = pop();
            pop();
        }
        else if (isOperator(c))
        {
            while (top != -1 && precedence(stack[top]) >= precedence(c) && !(c == '^' && stack[top] == '^'))
                postfix[k++] = pop();
            push(c);
        }
    }

    while (top != -1)
        postfix[k++] = pop();

    postfix[k] = '\0';
}
```
- **Purpose:** Converts an infix expression to a postfix expression.
- **Working:**
  1. **Looping through `infix` string:** 
     - `c = infix[i++]` assigns the current character in the `infix` string to `c`, then increments `i` for the next iteration.
  
  2. **If `c` is alphanumeric (operand):**
     - The operand (number or variable) is directly added to the `postfix` array at position `k` and `k` is incremented.
  
  3. **If `c` is an opening parenthesis `(`:**
     - The opening parenthesis is pushed onto the stack to signify that a sub-expression is starting.
  
  4. **If `c` is a closing parenthesis `)`:**
     - The algorithm pops all operators from the stack until an opening parenthesis is encountered.
     - The opening parenthesis is discarded (popped), as it is only used to group expressions.
  
  5. **If `c` is an operator:**
     - The algorithm pops operators from the stack that have higher or equal precedence compared to `c` (this ensures correct order of operators in postfix notation).
     - The condition `!(c == '^' && stack[top] == '^')` ensures that for the `^` operator, it doesn't pop another `^` operator because `^` is right-associative (i.e., `a^b^c` means `a^(b^c)`).
     - After checking the stack, the operator `c` is pushed onto the stack.

  6. **After the entire infix string is processed:**
     - All remaining operators in the stack are popped and appended to the `postfix` array.

---

#### **Main Function:**
```c
int main()
{
    char infix[MAX], postfix[MAX];

    printf("Enter infix expression: ");
    scanf("%s", infix);

    infixToPostfix(infix, postfix);

    printf("Postfix expression: %s\n", postfix);

    return 0;
}
```
- **Purpose:** The main function gets input from the user, converts it from infix to postfix, and displays the result.
- **Working:**
  1. The user is prompted to enter an infix expression (e.g., `3+5*(2^3)`).
  2. The `infixToPostfix()` function is called to convert the entered infix expression to a postfix expression.
  3. The resulting postfix expression is printed.

---

### Time Complexity:

- **Infix to Postfix Conversion:**
  - The loop iterates over each character of the infix expression exactly once. 
  - **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of characters in the infix expression.
  - Each operator or operand is pushed or popped from the stack at most once, so the overall complexity is linear with respect to the input size.
  
- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is O(n), where `n` is the number of characters in the infix expression, because the stack stores operators and operands, and the postfix array also stores the result.

---

### Example Walkthrough:

For the input infix expression `3+5*(2^3)`:

1. **Infix Expression:** `3 + 5 * ( 2 ^ 3 )`
2. **Process each character:**
   - `3` → Add to postfix → `postfix = "3"`
   - `+` → Push to stack → `stack = "+"`
   - `5` → Add to postfix → `postfix = "35"`
   - `*` → Push to stack → `stack = "+*"`
   - `(` → Push to stack → `stack = "+*("`
   - `2` → Add to postfix → `postfix = "352"`
   - `^` → Push to stack → `stack = "+*(^"`
   - `3` → Add to postfix → `postfix = "3523"`
   - `)` → Pop from stack until `(` → `postfix = "3523^*"`, then discard `(`
   - End of expression → Pop remaining operators from stack → `postfix = "3523^*+"`
3. **Final Postfix Expression:** `3523^*+`

---

### Conclusion:

This code successfully converts infix expressions (including the `^` operator) to postfix expressions using a stack. The time and space complexity are efficient, and the handling of operator precedence, associativity, and parentheses is correctly implemented.
