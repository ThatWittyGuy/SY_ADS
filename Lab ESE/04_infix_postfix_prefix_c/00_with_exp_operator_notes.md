### **Explanation of the Code in Blocks**

This C program is designed to convert an infix mathematical expression into both a **postfix** and **prefix** expression. The `^` operator is supported, and the code uses a **stack** to help with the conversion.

### **Global Variables:**
```c
#define MAX 100
char stack[MAX];
int top = -1;
```
- **MAX**: Defines the maximum size of the stack and other arrays.
- **stack[MAX]**: This array is used to store operators and parentheses temporarily during the conversion process.
- **top**: Keeps track of the top element of the stack. It starts at `-1`, which means the stack is initially empty.

---

### **Push Function:**
```c
void push(char c)
{
    if (top < MAX - 1)
        stack[++top] = c;
}
```
- **Purpose**: Adds an element to the stack.
- **Working**: If the stack is not full (i.e., `top < MAX - 1`), the function increments `top` and stores `c` in the stack at the new position `top`.

---

### **Pop Function:**
```c
char pop()
{
    if (top >= 0)
        return stack[top--];
    return -1;
}
```
- **Purpose**: Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
- **Working**: If the stack is not empty (i.e., `top >= 0`), the top element is returned, and the `top` index is decremented. If the stack is empty, it returns `-1` to indicate an empty stack.

---

### **Precedence Function:**
```c
int precedence(char c)
{
    if (c == '+' || c == '-')
        return 1;
    if (c == '*' || c == '/')
        return 2;
    if (c == '^')
        return 3;
    return 0;
}
```
- **Purpose**: Determines the precedence of the operators.
- **Working**:
  - `+` and `-` have the lowest precedence (`1`).
  - `*` and `/` have higher precedence (`2`).
  - `^` has the highest precedence (`3`).
  - Other characters (non-operators) are considered to have precedence `0`.

---

### **IsOperator Function:**
```c
int isOperator(char c)
{
    return (c == '+' || c == '-' || c == '*' || c == '/' || c == '^');
}
```
- **Purpose**: Checks if a character is a valid operator.
- **Working**: The function returns `1` if the character is one of `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, or `^`; otherwise, it returns `0`.

---

### **Infix to Postfix Conversion Function:**
```c
void infixToPostfix(char *infix, char *postfix)
{
    int k = 0;
    for (int i = 0; infix[i] != '\0'; i++)
    {
        char c = infix[i];
        if (isalnum(c))
        {
            postfix[k++] = c;
        }
        else if (c == '(')
        {
            push(c);
        }
        else if (c == ')')
        {
            while (top != -1 && stack[top] != '(')
                postfix[k++] = pop();
            pop();
        }
        else if (isOperator(c))
        {
            while (top != -1 && precedence(stack[top]) >= precedence(c) && !(c == '^' && stack[top] == '^'))
                postfix[k++] = pop();
            push(c);
        }
    }
    while (top != -1)
        postfix[k++] = pop();
    postfix[k] = '\0';
}
```
- **Purpose**: Converts an infix expression to a postfix expression.
- **Working**:
  1. **Loop over the infix expression**:
     - If the character `c` is an **operand** (using `isalnum`), it is directly added to the postfix expression (`postfix[k++] = c`).
     - If the character `c` is a **left parenthesis `(`**, it is pushed onto the stack (`push(c)`).
     - If the character `c` is a **right parenthesis `)`**, all operators are popped from the stack until a left parenthesis `(` is encountered. The left parenthesis is discarded.
     - If the character `c` is an **operator**, the algorithm compares its precedence with the operator on the top of the stack. It pops operators from the stack with higher or equal precedence (unless it's a `^` operator, which is right-associative).
  2. After processing all characters, any remaining operators in the stack are popped and added to the postfix expression.
  3. The postfix expression is terminated by a null character (`'\0'`).

### **Infix to Prefix Conversion Function:**
```c
void infixToPrefix(char *infix, char *prefix)
{
    int len = strlen(infix);
    char reversed[MAX];
    
    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++)
    {
        if (infix[i] == '(')
            reversed[len - i - 1] = ')';
        else if (infix[i] == ')')
            reversed[len - i - 1] = '(';
        else
            reversed[len - i - 1] = infix[i];
    }
    reversed[len] = '\0';

    char postfix[MAX];
    infixToPostfix(reversed, postfix);

    int postLen = strlen(postfix);
    for (int i = 0; i < postLen; i++)
    {
        prefix[i] = postfix[postLen - i - 1];
    }
    prefix[postLen] = '\0';
}
```
- **Purpose**: Converts an infix expression to a prefix expression.
- **Working**:
  1. **Reverse the infix expression**:
     - The expression is reversed to facilitate conversion to prefix. During this reversal, all parentheses are swapped (`(` becomes `)` and vice versa).
  2. **Convert reversed expression to postfix**:
     - The reversed infix expression is passed to the `infixToPostfix` function, which generates a postfix expression for the reversed input.
  3. **Reverse the postfix expression**:
     - The postfix expression is then reversed to obtain the correct prefix expression.
  4. The final prefix expression is terminated by a null character (`'\0'`).

---

### **Main Function:**
```c
int main()
{
    char infix[MAX], postfix[MAX], prefix[MAX];

    printf("Enter infix expression: ");
    scanf("%s", infix);

    infixToPostfix(infix, postfix);
    printf("Postfix expression: %s\n", postfix);

    infixToPrefix(infix, prefix);
    printf("Prefix expression: %s\n", prefix);

    return 0;
}
```
- **Purpose**: The main function drives the program by taking input from the user and calling the functions to convert the expression from infix to both postfix and prefix.
- **Working**:
  1. It prompts the user to enter an infix expression (e.g., `3+5*(2^3)`).
  2. The `infixToPostfix` function is called to convert the infix expression into postfix, and the result is printed.
  3. The `infixToPrefix` function is called to convert the infix expression into prefix, and the result is printed.
  4. The program exits after printing both the postfix and prefix expressions.

### **Time and Space Complexity Analysis**

#### **Time Complexity:**
- **Infix to Postfix Conversion (`infixToPostfix`)**:
  - The algorithm processes each character of the infix expression exactly once.
  - **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the infix expression.
  
- **Infix to Prefix Conversion (`infixToPrefix`)**:
  - Reversing the infix expression takes O(n).
  - Converting the reversed expression to postfix also takes O(n).
  - Reversing the resulting postfix expression also takes O(n).
  - **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the infix expression.
  
- **Overall Time Complexity**: The overall time complexity is O(n), where `n` is the length of the infix expression because both conversions (infix to postfix and infix to prefix) involve linear time operations.

#### **Space Complexity:**
- **Stack and Result Arrays**: We use additional space for the `stack` (size `MAX`) and the result arrays (`postfix`, `prefix`, `reversed`), which each take space proportional to the input size `n`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the infix expression.

### **Example Walkthrough**

For the infix expression: `3 + 5 * (2 ^ 3)`

1. **Infix to Postfix Conversion:**
   - Result: `3523^*+`
   
2. **Infix to Prefix Conversion:**
   - Result: `+3*523^`

---

### **Conclusion:**

This program efficiently converts an infix expression to both postfix and prefix using a stack to manage operator precedence and parentheses. It handles the `^` operator and works in linear time with respect to the length of the input expression. The space complexity is also linear due to the
