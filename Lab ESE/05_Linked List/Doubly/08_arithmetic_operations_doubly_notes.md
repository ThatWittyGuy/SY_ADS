Let's break down the provided C code step-by-step, explaining each part and analyzing the time complexity, result, and space complexity.

### Code Breakdown

#### 1. **Node Structure Definition**

```c
struct Node {
    int digit;
    struct Node* next;
    struct Node* prev;
};
```

- **Purpose:** 
  - Defines a `Node` structure for a **doubly linked list**. Each node stores an integer `digit` and has two pointers: one to the next node (`next`) and one to the previous node (`prev`).
  
- **Explanation:**
  - **`digit`**: Stores the value (digit) of the node.
  - **`next`**: Points to the next node in the list.
  - **`prev`**: Points to the previous node in the list. This allows for backward traversal in a doubly linked list.

#### 2. **append() Function**

```c
void append(struct Node** head, int digit) {
    struct Node* newNode = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    newNode->digit = digit;
    newNode->next = NULL;
    newNode->prev = NULL;
    
    if (*head == NULL) {
        *head = newNode;
    } else {
        struct Node* temp = *head;
        while (temp->next != NULL) {
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        temp->next = newNode;
        newNode->prev = temp;
    }
}
```

- **Purpose:** 
  - Adds a new node with the specified `digit` at the end of the doubly linked list.
  
- **Explanation:**
  - **Line 1:** Dynamically allocates memory for a new node using `malloc`.
  - **Line 2-3:** Sets the `digit` of the new node and initializes its `next` and `prev` pointers to `NULL`, indicating it is the last node initially.
  
  - **Line 5-8:** 
    - If the list is empty (`*head == NULL`), the new node becomes the first node, and the head of the list is updated to point to it.
  
  - **Lines 9-14:**
    - If the list is not empty, the function traverses the list using a temporary pointer `temp` to find the last node (`while (temp->next != NULL)`).
    - Once the last node is found, the new node is appended to it, and the `prev` pointer of the new node is set to point to the old last node (`newNode->prev = temp`).

- **Time Complexity:**
  - **O(n)** where `n` is the number of nodes in the list. This is because the function must traverse the list to find the last node, where `n` is the number of nodes already in the list.

#### 3. **printList() Function**

```c
void printList(struct Node* head) {
    if (head == NULL) {
        printf("List is empty\n");
        return;
    }

    while (head != NULL) {
        printf("%d -> ", head->digit);
        head = head->next;
    }
    printf("NULL");
    printf("\n");
}
```

- **Purpose:** 
  - Prints the digits in the list from head to tail (forward traversal).

- **Explanation:**
  - **Line 1:** Checks if the list is empty (`head == NULL`). If the list is empty, it prints `"List is empty"` and returns from the function.
  - **Lines 4-7:** 
    - The `while` loop traverses the list, printing each node's `digit` followed by `" -> "`. After printing the digit, the pointer `head` is moved to the next node (`head = head->next`).
  - **Line 8:** After the last node is reached, it prints `"NULL"` to indicate the end of the list.

- **Time Complexity:**
  - **O(n)** where `n` is the number of nodes in the list. Each node is visited exactly once during the traversal.

#### 4. **performOperation() Function**

```c
void performOperation(struct Node* head, int key, char operation) {
    struct Node* temp = head;
    while (temp != NULL) {
        if (operation == '+') {
            temp->digit += key;
        } else if (operation == '-') {
            temp->digit -= key;
        } else if (operation == '*') {
            temp->digit *= key;
        }
        temp = temp->next;
    }
}
```

- **Purpose:** 
  - This function performs an arithmetic operation (`+`, `-`, `*`) on each `digit` in the linked list with a given `key`.
  
- **Explanation:**
  - **Line 1:** Initializes a temporary pointer `temp` to point to the head of the list.
  - **Lines 2-7:** 
    - A `while` loop iterates over each node in the list. Depending on the value of `operation`:
      - If the operation is `'+'`, it adds the `key` to the node's `digit`.
      - If the operation is `'-'`, it subtracts the `key` from the node's `digit`.
      - If the operation is `'*'`, it multiplies the node's `digit` by the `key`.
  - **Line 8:** Moves the pointer `temp` to the next node in the list (`temp = temp->next`).

- **Time Complexity:**
  - **O(n)** where `n` is the number of nodes in the list. Each node is visited once to perform the operation.

#### 5. **main() Function**

```c
int main() {
    struct Node* head = NULL;
    int n, digit, key;
    char operation;

    printf("Enter the number of digits (max 10): ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    if (n > 10) {
        printf("Number of digits should be 10 or less.\n");
        return 0;
    }

    printf("Enter %d digits:\n", n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &digit);
        append(&head, digit);  // Append elements to maintain input order
    }

    printf("Original List: ");
    printList(head);

    printf("\nEnter a key (an integer) to perform arithmetic operations: ");
    scanf("%d", &key);

    printf("Choose operation:\n + for Addition, - for Subtraction, * for Multiplication: ");
    scanf(" %c", &operation);  // Space before %c to ignore newline

    performOperation(head, key, operation);

    printf("\nList after performing the operation: ");
    printList(head);

    return 0;
}
```

- **Purpose:**
  - This is the main driver function that handles input, manages the linked list, and performs the arithmetic operations on the digits in the list.
  
- **Explanation:**
  - **Line 4-6:** Declares the pointer `head` to represent the linked list and other variables (`n`, `digit`, `key`, and `operation`).
  - **Lines 8-13:** 
    - Prompts the user to input the number of digits to store in the list, ensuring that it does not exceed 10 digits.
    - Uses a loop to accept the digits and add them to the list by calling the `append()` function.
  - **Line 15:** Prints the original list by calling `printList()`.
  - **Lines 17-19:** Asks the user for the `key` (integer) and the arithmetic operation (`+`, `-`, or `*`).
  - **Line 21:** Calls `performOperation()` to modify the digits in the list according to the chosen operation.
  - **Line 23:** Prints the updated list after performing the operation.

- **Time Complexity:**
  - **O(n)** for appending `n` elements to the list.
  - **O(n)** for printing the list.
  - **O(n)** for performing the arithmetic operation on each node.
  
  Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the list.

### Overall Time Complexity:
- **O(n)** where `n` is the number of nodes in the list.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**, because we are storing `n` nodes in memory for the doubly linked list.

### Example Input and Output:

#### Input:
```
Enter the number of digits (max 10): 4
Enter 4 digits:
1 2 3 4
Original List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> NULL

Enter a key (an integer) to perform arithmetic operations: 2
Choose operation:
 + for Addition, - for Subtraction, * for Multiplication: +
List after performing the operation: 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> NULL
```

#### Output:
```
Original List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> NULL
List after performing the operation: 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> NULL
```

This example demonstrates the linked list with the operation `+2` applied to each digit. The result is printed after the arithmetic operation is performed on the list's digits.
