The code provided implements a singly linked list with functions to insert elements at the end, remove duplicates from the list, and print the list. Let's break down the code block by block.

### 1. **Struct Definition**
```c
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* next;
};
```
- This defines a `Node` structure. Each `Node` represents an element in the linked list. The `data` field stores the integer data of the node, and the `next` field is a pointer to the next node in the list.

### 2. **`InsertEnd` Function**
```c
void InsertEnd(struct Node** head, int data) {
    struct Node* newNode = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    newNode->data = data;
    newNode->next = NULL;

    if (*head == NULL) {
        *head = newNode;
    } else {
        struct Node* temp = *head;
        while (temp->next != NULL) {
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        temp->next = newNode;
    }
}
```
- **Purpose**: This function inserts a new node at the end of the linked list.
- **Explanation**:
  - A new node (`newNode`) is created with `malloc`, and its `data` is set to the provided `data`. The `next` pointer of the new node is initialized to `NULL` since it's the last node.
  - If the list is empty (`*head == NULL`), the new node becomes the first node, and `*head` is set to the new node.
  - If the list is not empty, we traverse the list to find the last node and set its `next` pointer to the new node.
  
- **Time Complexity**:  
  - The time complexity of inserting at the end of the list is **O(n)** because in the worst case, we traverse the entire list to find the last node.

### 3. **`PrintList` Function**
```c
void PrintList(struct Node* head) {
    while (head != NULL) {
        printf("%d -> ", head->data);
        head = head->next;
    }
    printf("NULL\n");
}
```
- **Purpose**: This function prints the entire linked list.
- **Explanation**:
  - It starts at the head of the list and iterates through each node.
  - For each node, it prints the `data` value followed by `->` to indicate the link to the next node.
  - Once it reaches the end of the list (when `head == NULL`), it prints `NULL` to indicate the end of the list.

- **Time Complexity**:  
  - The time complexity of this function is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the list, since it traverses each node once.

### 4. **`RemoveDuplicates` Function**
```c
void RemoveDuplicates(struct Node* head) {
    if (head == NULL) return;

    struct Node* current = head;
    while (current != NULL && current->next != NULL) {
        if (current->data == current->next->data) {
            struct Node* temp = current->next;
            current->next = current->next->next;
            free(temp);
        } else {
            current = current->next;
        }
    }
}
```
- **Purpose**: This function removes consecutive duplicate nodes from the sorted linked list.
- **Explanation**:
  - We start with the `head` of the list. If the list is empty (`head == NULL`), there is nothing to remove, so we return immediately.
  - We traverse the list using the `current` pointer. For each node, we check if the current node's data is equal to the next node's data (`current->data == current->next->data`).
    - If they are the same, it means we have a duplicate. We remove the duplicate by adjusting the `next` pointer of the current node (`current->next = current->next->next`) and free the memory of the duplicate node using `free(temp)`.
    - If the current node's data is not equal to the next node's data, we simply move the `current` pointer to the next node.
  
- **Time Complexity**:  
  - The time complexity of this function is **O(n)** because we only traverse the list once, and each node is processed in constant time.

### 5. **`main` Function**
```c
int main() {
    struct Node* head = NULL;
    int n, value;

    printf("Enter the number of elements: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    printf("Enter %d elements in sorted order:\n", n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        scanf("%d", &value);
        InsertEnd(&head, value);
    }

    printf("\nBefore removing duplicates: ");
    PrintList(head);

    RemoveDuplicates(head);

    printf("After removing duplicates: ");
    PrintList(head);

    return 0;
}
```
- **Purpose**: This is the main driver function where the linked list is created, duplicates are removed, and the list is printed before and after the removal of duplicates.
- **Explanation**:
  - The program first prompts the user to enter the number of elements (`n`), and then for each element, it calls `InsertEnd` to insert the data at the end of the linked list.
  - After inserting all elements, it prints the list before removing duplicates using the `PrintList` function.
  - The `RemoveDuplicates` function is then called to remove any duplicate elements from the sorted list.
  - Finally, it prints the list again after duplicates have been removed.

- **Time Complexity**:
  - **Input phase**: Inserting `n` elements into the list takes **O(n²)** time due to the `InsertEnd` function's traversal.
  - **Removing duplicates**: Removing duplicates takes **O(n)**.
  - **Printing the list**: Printing the list takes **O(n)**.
  - Therefore, the overall time complexity is dominated by the insertion phase, making it **O(n²)**.

### Example Input and Output:
**Input:**
```
Enter the number of elements: 7
Enter 7 elements in sorted order:
1 2 2 3 3 4 5

Before removing duplicates: 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL
After removing duplicates: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL
```

**Explanation:**
- The list initially contains duplicates (`2` and `3`). After the `RemoveDuplicates` function is called, the duplicates are removed, resulting in the list `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`.

### Time Complexity Analysis:
- **Insertion**: The `InsertEnd` function has a time complexity of **O(n)** for each insert, and since we're inserting `n` elements, the total time for insertion is **O(n²)**.
- **Removing Duplicates**: The `RemoveDuplicates` function has a time complexity of **O(n)**, as it processes each node exactly once.
- **Printing**: The `PrintList` function also has a time complexity of **O(n)**.
  
So, the overall time complexity is **O(n²)** due to the insertion phase being the most expensive. If we were to optimize the insertion (e.g., by maintaining a pointer to the last node), the time complexity could be improved to **O(n)** for insertion as well.
