Sure! Below is a detailed explanation of each part of the code in blocks. Each line will be explained with a breakdown of how the code works, and we will also analyze the results and time complexity.

---

### 1. **Defining the ListNode Structure**

```c
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    struct ListNode *next;
};
```
- **Explanation:**
  - This is the definition of a linked list node. Each node contains:
    - `val`: an integer that stores the value of the node.
    - `next`: a pointer to the next node in the linked list (or `NULL` if it's the last node).

---

### 2. **reverseBetween Function**
The core function `reverseBetween` reverses a section of the linked list between two indices (`startIndex` and `endIndex`).

#### Function Signature:
```c
void reverseBetween(struct ListNode **head, int startIndex, int endIndex) {
```
- **Explanation:**
  - `head`: A pointer to the head of the list (`ListNode **`) because the list is modified in place.
  - `startIndex` and `endIndex`: Indices between which the nodes should be reversed.

---

#### First Check: Ensure Valid Input
```c
if (*head == NULL || startIndex == endIndex) return;
```
- **Explanation:**
  - If the list is empty (`*head == NULL`), or if the `startIndex` is equal to `endIndex` (i.e., no reversal needed), the function returns immediately.

---

#### Creating a Dummy Node
```c
struct ListNode *dummy = (struct ListNode *)malloc(sizeof(struct ListNode));
dummy->next = *head;
```
- **Explanation:**
  - A dummy node is created to simplify edge cases like reversing from the head of the list.
  - The `dummy->next` points to the original head of the list.

---

#### Move `prev` to the Node Just Before `startIndex`
```c
struct ListNode *prev = dummy;
for (int i = 1; i < startIndex; i++) {
    prev = prev->next;
}
```
- **Explanation:**
  - We use a loop to move the `prev` pointer to the node just before the `startIndex`. This is necessary because we'll need to link the reversed portion back to this node.
  - `prev` will be the node just before the first node in the reversal section.

---

#### Reverse the Sublist Between `startIndex` and `endIndex`
```c
struct ListNode *curr = prev->next;
struct ListNode *next = NULL;
for (int i = startIndex; i < endIndex; i++) {
    next = curr->next;
    curr->next = next->next;
    next->next = prev->next;
    prev->next = next;
}
```
- **Explanation:**
  - `curr`: Points to the node at `startIndex` (the first node in the section to be reversed).
  - `next`: A temporary pointer used to store the next node while rearranging the pointers.
  - In the loop, we perform the following steps for each node to reverse:
    1. Save the next node (`next = curr->next`).
    2. Disconnect the `curr` node by pointing `curr->next` to `next->next` (skipping `next`).
    3. Place the `next` node at the beginning of the reversed section (`next->next = prev->next`).
    4. Attach `prev->next` to `next`, so the reversed section is correctly linked.
  - This loop performs the reversal operation for the portion of the list between `startIndex` and `endIndex`.

---

#### Final Update to Head
```c
*head = dummy->next;
free(dummy);
```
- **Explanation:**
  - After reversing, the `head` pointer might have changed (especially if the reversal involved the first few nodes). We update `*head` to point to the new head of the list (`dummy->next`).
  - We free the dummy node as it was only used for simplicity.

---

### 3. **printList Function**
The `printList` function is responsible for displaying the linked list.

```c
void printList(struct ListNode *head) {
    struct ListNode *temp = head;
    while (temp != NULL) {
        printf("%d ", temp->val);
        temp = temp->next;
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```
- **Explanation:**
  - The function takes the head of the list as an argument and prints each node's value in sequence.
  - It traverses the list using a `while` loop, printing each nodeâ€™s `val` and moving to the next node (`temp = temp->next`).
  - After traversing the list, it prints a newline.

---

### 4. **createList Function**
This function creates a linked list from an array of values.

```c
struct ListNode* createList(int size) {
    struct ListNode *head = NULL, *temp = NULL;
    int value;
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        printf("Enter value for node %d: ", i + 1);
        scanf("%d", &value);
        struct ListNode *newNode = (struct ListNode *)malloc(sizeof(struct ListNode));
        newNode->val = value;
        newNode->next = NULL;
        if (head == NULL) {
            head = newNode;
        } else {
            temp->next = newNode;
        }
        temp = newNode;
    }
    return head;
}
```
- **Explanation:**
  - The function takes an integer `size` which specifies how many nodes the user wants in the linked list.
  - It uses a loop to prompt the user to enter values for each node.
  - Each new node is created dynamically and linked together by updating the `next` pointer of the previous node (`temp->next = newNode`).

---

### 5. **main Function**
The main function drives the program by interacting with the user and using the other functions.

```c
int main() {
    int size, startIndex, endIndex;

    printf("Enter the number of nodes: ");
    scanf("%d", &size);

    struct ListNode *head = createList(size);

    printf("Enter start index and end index for reversal: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &startIndex, &endIndex);

    printf("Original List: ");
    printList(head);

    reverseBetween(&head, startIndex, endIndex);

    printf("Reversed List: ");
    printList(head);

    return 0;
}
```

- **Explanation:**
  - The program first asks for the number of nodes to create in the linked list.
  - Then it creates the linked list by calling `createList(size)`.
  - The user is prompted to enter the `startIndex` and `endIndex` for the reversal operation.
  - It prints the original list, then calls `reverseBetween` to reverse the sublist between the specified indices.
  - Finally, it prints the modified list after the reversal.

---

### **Example Analysis**
For the input:
```
Enter the number of nodes: 5
Enter value for node 1: 1
Enter value for node 2: 2
Enter value for node 3: 3
Enter value for node 4: 4
Enter value for node 5: 5
Enter start index and end index for reversal: 1 3
```
- **Original List:** `1 2 3 4 5`
- **Reversed List:** `3 2 1 4 5`

The sublist between indices `1` and `3` (inclusive) was reversed, so the new list is `3 2 1 4 5`.

### **Time Complexity Analysis**
- The function `reverseBetween` involves:
  - Moving the `prev` pointer to the `startIndex`, which takes **O(startIndex)** time.
  - Reversing the sublist, which takes **O(endIndex - startIndex)** time.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the list, since the function processes each node only once.

### **Space Complexity Analysis**
- The space complexity is **O(1)**, as we only use a few additional pointers (`dummy`, `prev`, `curr`, `next`), all of which are constant in space usage.
- The space complexity does not depend on the size of the input list because we are modifying the list in place (except for the dummy node, which is a constant size).
