Let's break down the code you provided in smaller blocks, explain each part line-by-line, and also analyze the result and time complexity.

### 1. **Struct Definition and Node Creation**

```c
struct Node {
    int coeff;
    int exp;
    struct Node *next;
};
```
- Defines a structure `Node` to represent a term in the polynomial. 
  - `coeff`: The coefficient of the term.
  - `exp`: The exponent of the term.
  - `next`: A pointer to the next node in the linked list.

```c
struct Node *CreateNode(int coeff, int exp) {
    struct Node *newNode = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    newNode->coeff = coeff;
    newNode->exp = exp;
    newNode->next = NULL;
    return newNode;
}
```
- `CreateNode`: A function that creates a new node with the given `coeff` (coefficient) and `exp` (exponent), initializes the `next` pointer to `NULL` (since it's the last node at the moment), and returns the pointer to the new node.

---

### 2. **Inserting Node in Sorted Order**

```c
void InsertNode(struct Node **head, int coeff, int exp) {
    struct Node *temp = *head;
    struct Node *prev = NULL;
```
- `InsertNode`: A function to insert a new node into the polynomial list in the correct position based on the exponent (`exp`).
- `temp`: Pointer to traverse the linked list.
- `prev`: Keeps track of the previous node for insertion purposes.

```c
    while (temp != NULL && temp->exp > exp) {
        prev = temp;
        temp = temp->next;
    }
```
- Traverses the list to find the correct position where the exponent `exp` is less than or equal to `temp->exp`.

```c
    if (temp != NULL && temp->exp == exp) {
        temp->coeff += coeff;
    } else {
        struct Node *newNode = CreateNode(coeff, exp);
        if (prev == NULL) {
            *head = newNode;
        } else {
            prev->next = newNode;
        }
        newNode->next = temp;
    }
}
```
- If a node with the same exponent already exists, its coefficient is updated by adding the new coefficient (`temp->coeff += coeff`).
- If no matching exponent is found, a new node is created, and it's inserted in the correct position in the list.
- If the list is empty (`prev == NULL`), the new node is the head of the list.

### 3. **Addition of Two Polynomials**

```c
void AddPolynomials(struct Node *p1, struct Node *p2, struct Node **result) {
    while (p1 != NULL && p2 != NULL) {
        if (p1->exp > p2->exp) {
            InsertNode(result, p1->coeff, p1->exp);
            p1 = p1->next;
        } else if (p1->exp < p2->exp) {
            InsertNode(result, p2->coeff, p2->exp);
            p2 = p2->next;
        } else {
            int sum = p1->coeff + p2->coeff;
            InsertNode(result, sum, p1->exp);
            p1 = p1->next;
            p2 = p2->next;
        }
    }
```
- `AddPolynomials`: A function to add two polynomials.
- It compares the exponents of the current nodes in both polynomials (`p1` and `p2`).
  - If `p1->exp > p2->exp`, the node from `p1` is added to the result.
  - If `p1->exp < p2->exp`, the node from `p2` is added to the result.
  - If both exponents are equal, the coefficients are added together, and the node with the sum is added to the result.

```c
    while (p1 != NULL) {
        InsertNode(result, p1->coeff, p1->exp);
        p1 = p1->next;
    }

    while (p2 != NULL) {
        InsertNode(result, p2->coeff, p2->exp);
        p2 = p2->next;
    }
}
```
- After one of the polynomials is fully traversed, any remaining nodes in the other polynomial are added to the result.

---

### 4. **Multiplication of Two Polynomials**

```c
void MultiplyPolynomials(struct Node *p1, struct Node *p2, struct Node **result) {
    struct Node *temp1 = p1, *temp2 = p2;
    while (temp1 != NULL) {
        while (temp2 != NULL) {
            int coeff = temp1->coeff * temp2->coeff;
            int exp = temp1->exp + temp2->exp;
            InsertNode(result, coeff, exp);
            temp2 = temp2->next;
        }
        temp1 = temp1->next;
        temp2 = p2;
    }
}
```
- `MultiplyPolynomials`: A function to multiply two polynomials.
- It loops through every term in `p1` and multiplies it with every term in `p2`, creating new terms and inserting them into the result list.
- The resulting exponent is the sum of the exponents of the two terms being multiplied.
- The coefficient is the product of the coefficients of the two terms.

---

### 5. **Printing the Polynomial**

```c
void PrintPolynomial(struct Node *head) {
    while (head != NULL) {
        printf("%dx^%d", head->coeff, head->exp);
        if (head->next != NULL) {
            printf(" + ");
        }
        head = head->next;
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```
- `PrintPolynomial`: A function to display the polynomial in human-readable form.
- It prints each term of the polynomial in the format `coeff x^exp`, with a " + " between terms.

---

### 6. **Main Function with Menu-Driven Program**

```c
int main() {
    struct Node *p1 = NULL, *p2 = NULL, *result = NULL;
    int choice, n, coeff, exp;

    while (1) {
        printf("\nMenu:\n");
        printf("1. Add Polynomials\n");
        printf("2. Multiply Polynomials\n");
        printf("3. Exit\n");
        printf("Enter your choice: ");
        scanf("%d", &choice);

        switch (choice) {
            case 1:
                p1 = p2 = result = NULL;
                printf("Enter number of terms in first polynomial: ");
                scanf("%d", &n);
                printf("Enter terms (coefficient and exponent) for the first polynomial:\n");
                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                    scanf("%d %d", &coeff, &exp);
                    InsertNode(&p1, coeff, exp);
                }

                printf("Enter number of terms in second polynomial: ");
                scanf("%d", &n);
                printf("Enter terms (coefficient and exponent) for the second polynomial:\n");
                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                    scanf("%d %d", &coeff, &exp);
                    InsertNode(&p2, coeff, exp);
                }

                AddPolynomials(p1, p2, &result);
                printf("Resultant polynomial after addition: ");
                PrintPolynomial(result);
                break;

            case 2:
                p1 = p2 = result = NULL;
                printf("Enter number of terms in first polynomial: ");
                scanf("%d", &n);
                printf("Enter terms (coefficient and exponent) for the first polynomial:\n");
                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                    scanf("%d %d", &coeff, &exp);
                    InsertNode(&p1, coeff, exp);
                }

                printf("Enter number of terms in second polynomial: ");
                scanf("%d", &n);
                printf("Enter terms (coefficient and exponent) for the second polynomial:\n");
                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                    scanf("%d %d", &coeff, &exp);
                    InsertNode(&p2, coeff, exp);
                }

                MultiplyPolynomials(p1, p2, &result);
                printf("Resultant polynomial after multiplication: ");
                PrintPolynomial(result);
                break;

            case 3:
                exit(0);

            default:
                printf("Invalid choice. Please try again.\n");
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```
- **Menu-Driven Interface**: The program repeatedly prompts the user to select between polynomial addition, multiplication, or exit.
- **Polynomial Input**: For both addition and multiplication, the user is prompted to input the terms of the two polynomials (each with a coefficient and exponent).
- **Operations**: Based on the choice, either `AddPolynomials` or `MultiplyPolynomials` is called.
- **Exit**: The program exits if the user selects `3`.

### **Time Complexity Analysis:**

- **Addition**: 
  - For each term in both polynomials, we traverse the lists and insert terms into the result. So, the time complexity is \( O(n + m) \), where \( n \) and \( m \) are the number of terms in the two polynomials.

- **Multiplication**:
  - For

 each term in `p1`, we multiply it with every term in `p2`, creating a new term for each combination. So, the time complexity is \( O(n \times m) \), where \( n \) and \( m \) are the number of terms in the two polynomials.

- **Printing**: 
  - Printing involves traversing the result list, so itâ€™s \( O(k) \), where \( k \) is the number of terms in the result.
