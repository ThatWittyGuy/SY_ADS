Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the C code that reverses a linked list:

### Structure Definition and Functions

```c
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* next;
};
```

- **Node Structure**: This structure defines a node in a singly linked list. Each node has:
  - `data`: an integer to store the value.
  - `next`: a pointer to the next node in the list.

### Reverse Function

```c
void reverse(struct Node** head) {
    struct Node* prev = NULL;
    struct Node* current = *head;
    struct Node* next = NULL;
    
    while (current != NULL) {
        next = current->next;
        current->next = prev;
        prev = current;
        current = next;
    }
    *head = prev;
}
```

- **Purpose**: The `reverse` function takes the address of the head of the linked list (`struct Node** head`), and reverses the list in-place.
  
- **Steps**:
  1. **Initialization**: 
     - `prev`: Initially set to `NULL`, it will become the new head of the list after reversal.
     - `current`: Points to the current node that needs to be processed. Initially, it points to the head of the list.
     - `next`: A temporary pointer to store the next node while we reverse the pointers.
  
  2. **Reversing Logic**: 
     - Loop through the list (`while (current != NULL)`), processing each node one by one.
     - For each node, the `next` pointer is stored temporarily, then the `current->next` pointer is reversed to point to the previous node (`prev`).
     - The `prev` pointer is moved to the current node, and the `current` pointer is moved to the next node in the original list.
  
  3. **Termination**: Once the loop ends, `prev` will be pointing to the new head of the reversed list, and we update the head pointer to `prev`.

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the list. Each node is visited exactly once and processed in constant time.

### Print Function

```c
void printList(struct Node* head) {
    while (head != NULL) {
        printf("%d -> ", head->data);
        head = head->next;
    }
    printf("NULL");
    printf("\n");
}
```

- **Purpose**: The `printList` function prints the elements of the linked list starting from the head. It prints each node's `data` followed by `->`, and at the end, it prints `NULL` to indicate the end of the list.
  
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is **O(n)** because it iterates through the list once to print each element.

### Append Function

```c
void append(struct Node** head, int data) {
    struct Node* newNode = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    struct Node* temp = *head;
    newNode->data = data;
    newNode->next = NULL;
    
    if (*head == NULL) {
        *head = newNode;
        return;
    }
    
    while (temp->next != NULL) {
        temp = temp->next;
    }
    temp->next = newNode;
}
```

- **Purpose**: The `append` function adds a new node with the given data at the end of the list.
  
- **Steps**:
  1. A new node is created using `malloc` and initialized with the given `data`.
  2. If the list is empty (`*head == NULL`), the new node becomes the head of the list.
  3. If the list is not empty, traverse to the last node (`while (temp->next != NULL)`), and set the `next` pointer of the last node to the new node.
  
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the list. In the worst case, we need to traverse the entire list to find the last node.

### Main Function

```c
int main() {
    struct Node* head = NULL;
    int n, data;
    
    printf("Enter the number of elements: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    
    printf("Enter the elements: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &data);
        append(&head, data);
    }
    
    printf("Original List: ");
    printList(head);
    
    reverse(&head);
    
    printf("Reversed List: ");
    printList(head);
    
    return 0;
}
```

- **Purpose**: The `main` function handles user input, calls the functions to append nodes, reverse the list, and display the results.

- **Steps**:
  1. **Input**: First, it asks for the number of elements (`n`) and reads the data for each node.
  2. **Appending**: For each element, the `append` function is called to add it to the list.
  3. **Display**: It prints the original list using the `printList` function.
  4. **Reversal**: The `reverse` function is called to reverse the list.
  5. **Display**: It prints the reversed list using the `printList` function.

### Sample Input/Output

#### Input:

```
Enter the number of elements: 5
Enter the elements: 1 2 3 4 5
```

#### Output:

```
Original List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL
Reversed List: 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL
```

### Time Complexity Analysis:

- **Appending**: The time complexity for appending is **O(n)** because for each append, we may have to traverse the entire list to find the last node.
- **Reversing**: The time complexity for reversing the list is **O(n)** because each node is processed exactly once.
- **Printing**: The time complexity for printing is **O(n)** because each node is visited once.

Overall, the time complexity for this program is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because all main operations (append, reverse, and print) are linear in terms of time complexity.
