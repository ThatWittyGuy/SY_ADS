Let's break down the given C code in detail, explaining each part of it and its respective time complexity analysis.

### Code Breakdown

#### 1. **Node Structure Definition**

```c
struct Node {
    int digit;
    struct Node* next;
};
```

- **Purpose:** 
  - This defines a `Node` structure used to represent a node in the singly linked list. Each node holds a single integer (`digit`) and a pointer (`next`) to the next node in the list.
- **Explanation:**
  - `digit`: An integer that stores the digit of the number in the list.
  - `next`: A pointer to the next node in the list, which allows the nodes to be connected in a chain.
  
#### 2. **append() Function**

```c
void append(struct Node** head, int digit) {
    struct Node* newNode = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    newNode->digit = digit;
    newNode->next = NULL;
    
    if (*head == NULL) {
        *head = newNode;
    } else {
        struct Node* temp = *head;
        while (temp->next != NULL) {
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        temp->next = newNode;
    }
}
```

- **Purpose:** 
  - This function appends a new node with a given `digit` at the end of the linked list.
  
- **Explanation:**
  - **Line 1:** A new node is dynamically allocated using `malloc`. The memory for this node is allocated on the heap.
  - **Line 2:** The `digit` value passed to the function is assigned to the `digit` field of the new node.
  - **Line 3:** The `next` pointer of the new node is set to `NULL`, indicating it's the last node in the list.
  
  - **If condition (`if (*head == NULL)`):**
    - If the list is empty (i.e., the `head` is `NULL`), the new node becomes the first node in the list (`head = newNode`).
  
  - **Else block:**
    - If the list is not empty, the function traverses the list to find the last node by following the `next` pointers (`while (temp->next != NULL)`), and then links the new node to the last node (`temp->next = newNode`).

- **Time Complexity:** 
  - **O(n)** where `n` is the number of nodes already present in the list. In the worst case, the function needs to traverse the entire list to find the last node.

#### 3. **printList() Function**

```c
void printList(struct Node* head) {
    if (head == NULL) {
        printf("List is empty\n");
        return;
    }

    while (head != NULL) {
        printf("%d -> ", head->digit);
        head = head->next;
    }
    printf("NULL");
    printf("\n");
}
```

- **Purpose:** 
  - This function prints all the digits in the linked list from the head to the last node, ending with `NULL` to indicate the end of the list.

- **Explanation:**
  - **Line 1:** If the list is empty (`head == NULL`), it prints `"List is empty"`.
  - **Lines 4-7:** The `while` loop iterates through each node in the list, printing the `digit` of each node followed by an arrow (`->`). After printing the digit of the current node, the pointer `head` is moved to the next node in the list (`head = head->next`).
  - **Line 8:** After reaching the last node, the loop exits and prints `NULL` to indicate the end of the list.

- **Time Complexity:** 
  - **O(n)** where `n` is the number of nodes in the list, since we must visit each node once to print its value.

#### 4. **performOperation() Function**

```c
void performOperation(struct Node* head, int key, char operation) {
    struct Node* temp = head;
    while (temp != NULL) {
        if (operation == '+') {
            temp->digit += key;
        } else if (operation == '-') {
            temp->digit -= key;
        } else if (operation == '*') {
            temp->digit *= key;
        }
        temp = temp->next;
    }
}
```

- **Purpose:** 
  - This function performs the specified arithmetic operation on each digit in the linked list.
  
- **Explanation:**
  - **Line 1:** A pointer `temp` is initialized to point to the head of the list.
  - **Line 2-9:** A `while` loop traverses through the list, performing the arithmetic operation on the `digit` of each node.
    - If the operation is `'+'`, the digit is incremented by the `key`.
    - If the operation is `'-'`, the digit is decremented by the `key`.
    - If the operation is `'*'`, the digit is multiplied by the `key`.
  - **Line 10:** After the operation is performed on the current node, `temp` is moved to the next node (`temp = temp->next`).

- **Time Complexity:**
  - **O(n)** where `n` is the number of nodes in the list. Each node is processed exactly once.

#### 5. **main() Function**

```c
int main() {
    struct Node* head = NULL;
    int n, digit, key;
    char operation;

    printf("Enter the number of digits (max 10): ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    if (n > 10) {
        printf("Number of digits should be 10 or less.\n");
        return 0;
    }

    printf("Enter %d digits:\n", n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &digit);
        append(&head, digit);  // Append elements to maintain input order
    }

    printf("Original List: ");
    printList(head);

    printf("\nEnter a key (an integer) to perform arithmetic operations: ");
    scanf("%d", &key);

    printf("Choose operation:\n + for Addition, - for Subtraction, * for Multiplication: ");
    scanf(" %c", &operation);  // Space before %c to ignore newline

    performOperation(head, key, operation);

    printf("\nList after performing the operation: ");
    printList(head);

    return 0;
}
```

- **Purpose:**
  - This is the main driver function that manages user input, initializes the linked list, and applies the arithmetic operations to the list.
  
- **Explanation:**
  - **Lines 4-6:** Declares the pointer `head` to represent the linked list and other variables (`n`, `digit`, `key`, and `operation`).
  - **Lines 8-13:** Reads the number of digits to be entered, checks if it is within the valid range (1 to 10), and then reads the digits and appends them to the list using the `append()` function.
  - **Line 15:** Prints the original list by calling `printList()`.
  - **Lines 17-19:** Prompts the user for a key (integer) and the desired arithmetic operation (`+`, `-`, or `*`).
  - **Line 21:** Calls the `performOperation()` function to apply the operation on the list.
  - **Line 23:** Prints the updated list after performing the operation.

- **Time Complexity:** 
  - **O(n)** where `n` is the number of nodes in the list. This is because the list is traversed to append digits, perform the operation, and print the list.

### Overall Time Complexity:
- **append()**: O(n) per insertion (where `n` is the number of elements in the list).
- **printList()**: O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the list.
- **performOperation()**: O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the list.

Thus, for this code, the overall time complexity for all the operations is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the linked list.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)** for storing the `n` nodes of the linked list.

### Example Input and Output:

#### Input:
```
Enter the number of digits (max 10): 4
Enter 4 digits:
1 2 3 4
Original List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> NULL

Enter a key (an integer) to perform arithmetic operations: 2
Choose operation:
 + for Addition, - for Subtraction, * for Multiplication: +
List after performing the operation: 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> NULL
```

#### Output:
The program prints the list before and after performing the chosen operation.
