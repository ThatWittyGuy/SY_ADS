### Full Explanation of the Code:

This program splits a list into two sublists, one for the front half and one for the back half. If the number of elements is odd, the extra element goes into the front list. It takes the list from the user as input, splits it, and then outputs the two sublists.

#### 1. **Include Necessary Libraries**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
```
- `#include <stdio.h>`: Includes the standard input-output library to use `printf`, `scanf` functions.
- `#include <stdlib.h>`: Includes the standard library to use dynamic memory allocation (`malloc` and `free`).

#### 2. **FrontBackSplit Function**
```c
void FrontBackSplit(int arr[], int n, int **front, int *front_size, int **back, int *back_size) {
    int mid = (n + 1) / 2;  // Determine the middle point (extra element in front for odd-length lists)
    
    *front_size = mid; // Front size is the first half or one extra element if odd
    *back_size = n - mid; // Back size is the remainder

    *front = (int*)malloc(*front_size * sizeof(int));
    *back = (int*)malloc(*back_size * sizeof(int));

    // Fill the front and back lists
    for (int i = 0; i < *front_size; i++) {
        (*front)[i] = arr[i];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < *back_size; i++) {
        (*back)[i] = arr[*front_size + i];
    }
}
```

- **Function Purpose**: This function takes the original array `arr[]` and splits it into two sublists: `front` and `back`.
  
- **Parameters**:
  - `arr[]`: Original array to be split.
  - `n`: Number of elements in the original array.
  - `front`: Pointer to the dynamically allocated front sublist (output).
  - `front_size`: Size of the front sublist (output).
  - `back`: Pointer to the dynamically allocated back sublist (output).
  - `back_size`: Size of the back sublist (output).

- **Logic**:
  - `mid = (n + 1) / 2`: This calculates the middle index of the array. For odd-length arrays, the extra element is placed in the front sublist, ensuring the front list has more or equal elements than the back list.
  - `*front_size = mid`: Assigns the size of the front list.
  - `*back_size = n - mid`: Assigns the size of the back list.
  - Dynamically allocates memory for the front and back lists using `malloc`.
  - **First loop**: Copies the first `*front_size` elements from the original array into the front list.
  - **Second loop**: Copies the remaining elements into the back list.

#### 3. **printList Function**
```c
void printList(int arr[], int size) {
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }
}
```
- **Function Purpose**: This function prints the elements of the array `arr[]` with the specified `size`.
- **Logic**: 
  - It iterates through the array and prints each element followed by a space.

---

#### 4. **Main Function**
```c
int main() {
    int n;

    printf("Enter the number of elements: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    int arr[n];
    printf("Enter the elements: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &arr[i]);
    }

    int *front, *back, front_size, back_size;

    FrontBackSplit(arr, n, &front, &front_size, &back, &back_size);

    printf("Front list: ");
    printList(front, front_size);
    printf("\n");

    printf("Back list: ");
    printList(back, back_size);
    printf("\n");

    // Free the dynamically allocated memory
    free(front);
    free(back);

    return 0;
}
```
- **Input/Output Operations**:
  - The program asks the user for the number of elements (`n`) in the array and reads them into the `arr[]` array.
  - Then it calls the `FrontBackSplit()` function to split the array into the front and back sublists.
  - The program then prints both the front and back sublists using `printList()`.

- **Memory Allocation**:
  - `front` and `back` pointers are dynamically allocated memory in the `FrontBackSplit()` function.
  - After use, the dynamically allocated memory is freed using `free(front)` and `free(back)`.

### Sample Input and Output:

#### **Example 1**:
**Input**:
```
Enter the number of elements: 6
Enter the elements: 1 2 3 4 5 6
```

**Output**:
```
Front list: 1 2 3 
Back list: 4 5 6
```

#### **Example 2**:
**Input**:
```
Enter the number of elements: 5
Enter the elements: 1 2 3 4 5
```

**Output**:
```
Front list: 1 2 3 
Back list: 4 5
```

### Analysis:

- **Correctness**:
  - The program correctly handles both even and odd cases. 
    - In the case of an odd number of elements, the front list gets one more element than the back list, as specified in the problem.
  - For example, in the input `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`, the front list contains `{1, 2, 3}` and the back list contains `{4, 5}`, as expected.

- **Time Complexity**:
  - **Splitting the list**: The `FrontBackSplit()` function iterates through the entire list once to copy elements into the front and back sublists. Thus, it takes `O(n)` time, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.
  - **Printing the lists**: The `printList()` function also iterates through each sublist, taking `O(n)` time in total for both lists (as each element is printed exactly once).
  - **Overall Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the original list.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - **Memory Allocation**: The program uses two dynamic arrays, `front` and `back`, which together require `O(n)` space to store all elements of the original array split into two sublists.
  - **Overall Space Complexity**: `O(n)`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Empty List**: If `n = 0`, the program will not perform any allocation and the output will be empty lists.
  - **Single Element**: If `n = 1`, the front list will contain that single element, and the back list will be empty.

This implementation is efficient, with a linear time complexity and space complexity, and handles both odd and even cases correctly.
