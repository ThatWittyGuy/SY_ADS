### Full Explanation of the Code

The program performs the following key operations:

1. **Creating a linked list** with user input.
2. **Appending one linked list** (`b`) to the end of another linked list (`a`).
3. **Printing the final list** after the append operation.

We will break down each section of the code and explain it step by step.

### Structure Definition
```c
struct Node
{
    int data;
    struct Node *next;
};
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The `struct Node` defines the structure of a linked list node. 
  - Each node contains an integer `data` and a pointer `next` to the next node in the list.
  - The `next` pointer helps link nodes together, making the structure a singly linked list.

### `Append` Function
```c
void Append(struct Node **a, struct Node **b)
{
    if (*a == NULL)
    {
        *a = *b;
    }
    else
    {
        struct Node *temp = *a;
        while (temp->next != NULL)
        {
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        temp->next = *b;
    }
    *b = NULL;
}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The `Append` function takes two pointers to pointers to nodes (`**a` and `**b`).
  - It appends the list `b` at the end of list `a`:
    - If `a` is empty (i.e., `*a == NULL`), the head of `a` is set to point to the head of `b`, making `a` point to `b`.
    - If `a` is not empty, it traverses the list `a` using a `temp` pointer until it finds the last node (i.e., where `temp->next == NULL`).
    - It then connects the last node of `a` to the head of `b`, effectively appending `b` to `a`.
  - Finally, `*b` is set to `NULL` to ensure that `b` is now an empty list, avoiding unintended modifications to the original `b`.

### `PrintList` Function
```c
void PrintList(struct Node *head)
{
    while (head != NULL)
    {
        printf("%d -> ", head->data);
        head = head->next;
    }
    printf("NULL\n");
}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The `PrintList` function prints the entire linked list starting from `head`.
  - It traverses the list, printing the `data` of each node followed by " -> ".
  - When it reaches the last node (where `head == NULL`), it prints `"NULL"` to indicate the end of the list.

---

### `CreateNode` Function
```c
struct Node *CreateNode(int data)
{
    struct Node *newNode = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    newNode->data = data;
    newNode->next = NULL;
    return newNode;
}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The `CreateNode` function creates a new node, allocates memory for it using `malloc`, and initializes its `data` field with the provided `data` value.
  - The `next` pointer is initialized to `NULL`, indicating that it doesn't point to any next node yet.
  - It returns a pointer to the newly created node.

### `main` Function
```c
int main()
{
    struct Node *a = NULL, *b = NULL;
    int n, data;

    // Get user input for list a
    printf("Enter number of elements for list a: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    printf("Enter %d elements for list a:\n", n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        scanf("%d", &data);
        if (a == NULL)
        {
            a = CreateNode(data);
        }
        else
        {
            struct Node *temp = a;
            while (temp->next != NULL)
            {
                temp = temp->next;
            }
            temp->next = CreateNode(data);
        }
    }

    // Get user input for list b
    printf("Enter number of elements for list b: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    printf("Enter %d elements for list b:\n", n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        scanf("%d", &data);
        if (b == NULL)
        {
            b = CreateNode(data);
        }
        else
        {
            struct Node *temp = b;
            while (temp->next != NULL)
            {
                temp = temp->next;
            }
            temp->next = CreateNode(data);
        }
    }

    // Append list b to list a
    Append(&a, &b);

    // Print the resulting list
    printf("Resulting list after appending: ");
    PrintList(a);

    return 0;
}
```

- **Explanation**:
  - **List `a` Creation**:
    - We first prompt the user to enter the number of elements for list `a`.
    - For each element, we read the integer and create a new node, linking it to the existing list `a`.
    - If the list is empty (`a == NULL`), we create the first node. Otherwise, we traverse to the end of the list and append the new node.
  - **List `b` Creation**:
    - Similarly, we prompt the user for the number of elements for list `b`, and create and append nodes to list `b`.
  - **Appending List `b` to List `a`**:
    - After both lists are created, we call the `Append` function to merge list `b` at the end of list `a`.
  - **Printing the Final List**:
    - Finally, we print the resulting list after the append operation using the `PrintList` function.

### Time Complexity Analysis

1. **Creating list `a`**:
   - Each node insertion takes **O(n)** time where `n` is the number of nodes in `a`.
   - The insertion involves traversing the list to find the end. In the worst case, the time complexity is **O(n)**.

2. **Creating list `b`**:
   - Similarly, creating list `b` involves **O(m)** time, where `m` is the number of nodes in `b`.

3. **Appending list `b` to list `a`**:
   - The `Append` function first traverses list `a` to find the end. This traversal takes **O(n)** time, where `n` is the number of nodes in `a`.
   - The operation of setting `temp->next = *b` is constant time, **O(1)**.

4. **Printing the final list**:
   - The `PrintList` function traverses the entire list and prints the data, taking **O(n + m)** time, where `n` and `m` are the number of nodes in lists `a` and `b`, respectively.

---

### Overall Time Complexity
- The time complexity for the whole program is dominated by:
  - **O(n + m)** for creating the two lists.
  - **O(n)** for appending list `b` to list `a`.
  - **O(n + m)** for printing the final list.

Thus, the total time complexity is **O(n + m)**, where `n` is the size of list `a` and `m` is the size of list `b`.

---

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is primarily **O(n + m)** because we are creating `n + m` nodes in total (where `n` is the number of nodes in `a` and `m` is the number of nodes in `b`). Each node requires space for the `data` and `next` pointer.
