### Explanation of the Code:

This code partitions a singly linked list around a given value `x` such that all nodes with values less than `x` appear before nodes with values greater than or equal to `x`. Additionally, the relative order of nodes within the partitions should remain unchanged. The solution traverses the list only once and does not create a new linked list.

#### Structure Definition

```c
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* next;
};
```
- The `Node` structure represents each element in the linked list. 
- `data` holds the node's value, and `next` is a pointer to the next node in the list.

#### `append` Function: Adds a node to the end of the linked list.

```c
void append(struct Node** head, int data) {
    struct Node* newNode = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    struct Node* temp = *head;
    newNode->data = data;
    newNode->next = NULL;
    
    if (*head == NULL) {
        *head = newNode;
        return;
    }

    while (temp->next != NULL) {
        temp = temp->next;
    }
    temp->next = newNode;
}
```
- **Input**: A pointer to the head of the linked list and the data to be added.
- A new node is created with the given `data`.
- If the list is empty (`*head == NULL`), the new node becomes the head of the list.
- If the list is not empty, the function traverses to the last node (using `temp`), and the new node is linked as the next node of the last node.

#### `partitionList` Function: Partitions the list based on value `x`.

```c
void partitionList(struct Node** head, int x) {
    struct Node *lessHead = NULL, *greaterHead = NULL;
    struct Node *lessTail = NULL, *greaterTail = NULL;
    struct Node* temp = *head;
```
- **Input**: A pointer to the head of the list and the partition value `x`.
- The function creates two dummy linked lists (`lessHead` and `greaterHead`), which will store nodes with values less than `x` and nodes with values greater than or equal to `x`, respectively.
- `lessTail` and `greaterTail` are used to keep track of the last node in each of these lists.

```c
    while (temp != NULL) {
        if (temp->data < x) {
            if (lessHead == NULL) {
                lessHead = temp;
                lessTail = lessHead;
            } else {
                lessTail->next = temp;
                lessTail = lessTail->next;
            }
        } else {
            if (greaterHead == NULL) {
                greaterHead = temp;
                greaterTail = greaterHead;
            } else {
                greaterTail->next = temp;
                greaterTail = greaterTail->next;
            }
        }
        temp = temp->next;
    }
```
- The function traverses the original linked list node by node.
- If the node's value is less than `x`, it is added to the `less` partition.
- If the node's value is greater than or equal to `x`, it is added to the `greater` partition.
- For each partition, `lessTail` and `greaterTail` are updated to point to the newly added node.
- `temp` moves to the next node in the list for the next iteration.

```c
    if (lessTail != NULL) {
        lessTail->next = greaterHead;
    }

    if (greaterTail != NULL) {
        greaterTail->next = NULL;
    }
```
- After the loop, if the `less` partition contains any nodes, `lessTail->next` is set to point to `greaterHead` to merge the two partitions.
- If the `greater` partition is not empty, the `greaterTail->next` is set to `NULL` to mark the end of the list.

```c
    *head = (lessHead != NULL) ? lessHead : greaterHead;
}
```
- The head of the list is updated to point to `lessHead`, if the `less` partition contains any nodes. Otherwise, it is set to point to `greaterHead`.

#### `printList` Function: Prints the linked list.

```c
void printList(struct Node* head) {
    while (head != NULL) {
        printf("%d -> ", head->data);
        head = head->next;
    }
    printf("NULL\n");
}
```
- **Input**: A pointer to the head of the linked list.
- This function traverses the linked list and prints each node's value, followed by `->`, and ends with `NULL` to indicate the end of the list.

#### `main` Function: Driver for the program.

```c
int main() {
    struct Node* head = NULL;
    int n, data, x;

    printf("Enter the number of elements: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    printf("Enter the elements: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &data);
        append(&head, data);
    }

    printf("Enter the partition value (x): ");
    scanf("%d", &x);

    printf("Original List: ");
    printList(head);

    partitionList(&head, x);

    printf("Partitioned List: ");
    printList(head);

    return 0;
}
```
- **Input**: The number of elements (`n`), the elements themselves (`data`), and the partition value `x`.
- The list is constructed by calling `append` for each element.
- The original list is printed.
- The `partitionList` function is called to partition the list based on the value `x`.
- The partitioned list is printed.

### Example Input and Output

#### Example 1:

**Input:**
```
Enter the number of elements: 5
Enter the elements: 66 7 44 3 21
Enter the partition value (x): 35
```

**Output:**
```
Original List: 66 -> 7 -> 44 -> 3 -> 21 -> NULL
Partitioned List: 7 -> 3 -> 21 -> 66 -> 44 -> NULL
```

#### Example 2:

**Input:**
```
Enter the number of elements: 4
Enter the elements: 1 4 3 2
Enter the partition value (x): 3
```

**Output:**
```
Original List: 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> NULL
Partitioned List: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> NULL
```

### Time and Space Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - **O(n)**: We only traverse the list once, where `n` is the number of elements in the list.
  
- **Space Complexity**: 
  - **O(1)**: We only use a constant amount of extra space for the `less` and `greater` partitions, and we do not create new nodes or lists.
