Let's break down the provided code into individual sections and explain each line. The code implements a **queue using two stacks** in a menu-driven approach, allowing enqueue, dequeue, and display operations.

---

### 1. **Header Files and Stack Structure Definition**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
```
- `#include <stdio.h>`: Includes the standard I/O library which is required for functions like `printf()` and `scanf()`.
- `#include <stdlib.h>`: Includes the standard library which is required for functions like `exit()`, which is used to terminate the program.

```c
struct Stack {
    int top;
    int arr[5];
};
```
- `struct Stack`: Defines a `Stack` structure.
  - `int top`: Keeps track of the index of the top element in the stack. Initially, it is set to `-1`, indicating an empty stack.
  - `int arr[5]`: Array of fixed size `5` to store the elements of the stack.

---

### 2. **Stack Initialization Function**

```c
void initStack(struct Stack* stack) {
    stack->top = -1;
}
```
- `initStack(struct Stack* stack)`: This function initializes a stack by setting the `top` of the stack to `-1`, which means the stack is initially empty.

---

### 3. **Stack Operations: Checking Empty and Full States**

```c
int isEmpty(struct Stack* stack) {
    return stack->top == -1;
}
```
- `isEmpty(struct Stack* stack)`: This function checks if the stack is empty by returning `1` (true) if `top == -1`, otherwise it returns `0` (false).

```c
int isFull(struct Stack* stack) {
    return stack->top == 4;
}
```
- `isFull(struct Stack* stack)`: This function checks if the stack is full by returning `1` (true) if `top == 4` (since the array size is `5`, the maximum index is `4`), otherwise it returns `0` (false).

---

### 4. **Push Operation**

```c
void push(struct Stack* stack, int value) {
    if (isFull(stack)) {
        printf("Stack is full\n");
        return;
    }
    stack->arr[++stack->top] = value;
}
```
- `push(struct Stack* stack, int value)`: This function pushes an element `value` onto the stack.
  - `if (isFull(stack))`: If the stack is full, it prints an error message and exits the function.
  - `stack->arr[++stack->top] = value;`: If the stack is not full, it increments the `top` pointer and assigns the value to the stack's array.

---

### 5. **Pop Operation**

```c
int pop(struct Stack* stack) {
    if (isEmpty(stack)) {
        printf("Stack is empty\n");
        return -1;
    }
    return stack->arr[stack->top--];
}
```
- `pop(struct Stack* stack)`: This function pops an element from the stack.
  - `if (isEmpty(stack))`: If the stack is empty, it prints an error message and returns `-1` to indicate that no element was popped.
  - `return stack->arr[stack->top--];`: If the stack is not empty, it returns the value at the top of the stack and then decrements the `top` pointer.

---

### 6. **Enqueue Operation Using Two Stacks**

```c
void enqueue(struct Stack* s1, struct Stack* s2, int value) {
    push(s1, value);
}
```
- `enqueue(struct Stack* s1, struct Stack* s2, int value)`: This function enqueues a value into the queue by pushing it onto the first stack `s1`. 
  - The second stack `s2` is not used in this function because the enqueuing operation only requires inserting into the first stack.

---

### 7. **Dequeue Operation Using Two Stacks**

```c
int dequeue(struct Stack* s1, struct Stack* s2) {
    if (isEmpty(s1) && isEmpty(s2)) {
        printf("Queue is empty\n");
        return -1;
    }
    if (isEmpty(s2)) {
        while (!isEmpty(s1)) {
            push(s2, pop(s1));
        }
    }
    return pop(s2);
}
```
- `dequeue(struct Stack* s1, struct Stack* s2)`: This function dequeues an element from the queue.
  - `if (isEmpty(s1) && isEmpty(s2))`: Checks if both stacks are empty. If true, the queue is empty, and the function returns `-1`.
  - `if (isEmpty(s2))`: If the second stack `s2` is empty, it transfers all elements from `s1` to `s2` in reverse order by popping from `s1` and pushing onto `s2`. This ensures that the order of elements is maintained when dequeuing.
  - `return pop(s2);`: After transferring elements from `s1` to `s2`, the top element of `s2` is the element to be dequeued.

---

### 8. **Display Operation**

```c
void display(struct Stack* s1, struct Stack* s2) {
    if (isEmpty(s1) && isEmpty(s2)) {
        printf("Queue is empty\n");
        return;
    }
    struct Stack temp;
    initStack(&temp);
    while (!isEmpty(s2)) {
        push(&temp, pop(s2));
    }
    while (!isEmpty(s1)) {
        printf("%d ", s1->arr[s1->top]);
    }
    while (!isEmpty(&temp)) {
        printf("%d ", pop(&temp));
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```
- `display(struct Stack* s1, struct Stack* s2)`: This function displays the elements in the queue.
  - `if (isEmpty(s1) && isEmpty(s2))`: If both stacks are empty, it prints "Queue is empty" and exits the function.
  - `struct Stack temp; initStack(&temp);`: A temporary stack `temp` is initialized.
  - `while (!isEmpty(s2)) { push(&temp, pop(s2)); }`: All elements from `s2` are moved to the temporary stack `temp` to restore their original order.
  - `while (!isEmpty(s1))`: The remaining elements in `s1` are printed in order.
  - `while (!isEmpty(&temp))`: The elements from the temporary stack are printed.

---

### 9. **Main Function**

```c
int main() {
    struct Stack s1, s2;
    int choice, value;
    initStack(&s1);
    initStack(&s2);

    while (1) {
        printf("\nMenu:\n");
        printf("1. Enqueue\n");
        printf("2. Dequeue\n");
        printf("3. Display\n");
        printf("4. Exit\n");
        printf("Enter your choice: ");
        scanf("%d", &choice);

        switch (choice) {
            case 1:
                printf("Enter value to enqueue: ");
                scanf("%d", &value);
                enqueue(&s1, &s2, value);
                break;
            case 2:
                value = dequeue(&s1, &s2);
                if (value != -1) {
                    printf("Dequeued: %d\n", value);
                }
                break;
            case 3:
                display(&s1, &s2);
                break;
            case 4:
                exit(0);
            default:
                printf("Invalid choice, try again.\n");
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```
- **Stack Initialization**: The two stacks `s1` and `s2` are initialized.
- **Menu Loop**: A loop that repeatedly displays a menu to the user until the user chooses to exit.
  - **Choice 1**: Calls the `enqueue` function to add a value to the queue.
  - **Choice 2**: Calls the `dequeue` function to remove and display an element from the queue.
  - **Choice 3**: Calls the `display` function to print all elements of the queue.
  - **Choice 4**: Exits the program.

---

### **Time Complexity Analysis**

- **Enqueue Operation (Push to `s1`)**: O(1) – Inserting an element into `s1` is done in constant time.
- **Dequeue Operation**:
  - **If `s2` is Empty**: O(n) – All `n` elements from `s1` are transferred to `s2` (where `n` is the number of elements in the queue).
  - **After Transfer**: O(1) – Popping from `s2` is done in constant time.
- **Display Operation**: O(n) – The function needs to print all elements from `s1` and `s2`, and it may temporarily transfer elements to a temporary stack.

### **Space Complexity**
- **O(n)** – The space complexity is linear in terms of the number of elements in the queue since the queue uses two stacks, each holding up to `n` elements.

---

### **Summary**

This code implements a queue using two stacks. The primary advantage of this method is that both enqueue and dequeue operations can

 be done in amortized O(1) time, but in the worst case, dequeue takes O(n) time when the elements need to be transferred from one stack to another. The space complexity is O(n) due to the two stacks holding the queue's elements.
