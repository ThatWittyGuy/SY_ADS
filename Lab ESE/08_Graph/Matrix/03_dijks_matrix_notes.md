### Code Explanation and Analysis

This program implements **Dijkstra's Algorithm** to find the shortest path between two vertices in a weighted, directed graph. The graph is represented as an adjacency matrix, where non-zero values represent edge weights, and `0` represents no edge.

We will break down the code into smaller blocks, explain each line, and analyze the result and time complexity.

### **1. Header Files and Constants**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>

#define MAX_VERTICES 10
```
- `#include <stdio.h>`: Includes the standard input/output library, which provides functions like `printf()` and `scanf()` for handling input and output.
- `#include <limits.h>`: Provides limits for integral types like `INT_MAX`, which is used to represent an infinite distance.
- `#define MAX_VERTICES 10`: Defines a constant `MAX_VERTICES`, setting the maximum number of vertices in the graph to 10. This can be adjusted as needed.

---

### **2. `minDistance` Function**
```c
int minDistance(int dist[], int sptSet[], int V)
{
    int min = INT_MAX, minIndex;
    for (int v = 0; v < V; v++)
    {
        if (sptSet[v] == 0 && dist[v] < min)
        {
            min = dist[v];
            minIndex = v;
        }
    }
    return minIndex;
}
```
- **Purpose**: Finds the vertex with the minimum distance that has not yet been included in the Shortest Path Tree (SPT).
- **Parameters**:
  - `dist[]`: Array holding the current shortest distances from the source to all vertices.
  - `sptSet[]`: Boolean array where `sptSet[v]` is `1` if vertex `v` is included in the SPT (Shortest Path Tree), and `0` otherwise.
  - `V`: The number of vertices in the graph.

- **Explanation**:
  - `min = INT_MAX`: Initializes `min` to infinity to ensure any valid distance will be smaller.
  - `for (int v = 0; v < V; v++)`: Loops through all vertices.
  - `if (sptSet[v] == 0 && dist[v] < min)`: Checks if vertex `v` is not yet in the SPT (`sptSet[v] == 0`) and if the distance `dist[v]` is smaller than the current minimum distance (`min`).
  - `min = dist[v]`: If the above condition is met, update the minimum distance and store the index (`minIndex`).
  - Finally, the function returns the index of the vertex with the smallest distance (`minIndex`).

### **3. `dijkstra` Function**
```c
int dijkstra(int graph[MAX_VERTICES][MAX_VERTICES], int V, int src, int dest)
{
    int dist[V];
    int sptSet[V];

    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
    {
        dist[i] = INT_MAX;
        sptSet[i] = 0;
    }

    dist[src] = 0;
```
- **Purpose**: Implements Dijkstra's Algorithm to compute the shortest path from a source vertex `src` to a destination vertex `dest`.
- **Parameters**:
  - `graph[MAX_VERTICES][MAX_VERTICES]`: The adjacency matrix of the graph.
  - `V`: The number of vertices in the graph.
  - `src`: The source vertex from which to find the shortest path.
  - `dest`: The destination vertex for which to find the shortest path.

- **Explanation**:
  - `dist[V]`: Array to store the shortest distance from the source vertex to each vertex. Initially, all values are set to infinity (`INT_MAX`).
  - `sptSet[V]`: Array that keeps track of whether a vertex is included in the Shortest Path Tree (SPT). Initially, all vertices are set to `0` (not included).
  - `for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)`: Initializes all distances to `INT_MAX` and sets all vertices as not yet visited (`sptSet[i] = 0`).
  - `dist[src] = 0`: The distance from the source vertex to itself is 0.

---

```c
    for (int count = 0; count < V - 1; count++)
    {
        int u = minDistance(dist, sptSet, V);
        sptSet[u] = 1;

        for (int v = 0; v < V; v++)
        {
            if (graph[u][v] && sptSet[v] == 0 && dist[u] != INT_MAX && dist[u] + graph[u][v] < dist[v])
            {
                dist[v] = dist[u] + graph[u][v];
            }
        }
    }

    return dist[dest];
}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The outer `for` loop runs `V-1` times, ensuring each vertex is processed once.
  - **Step 1**: `int u = minDistance(dist, sptSet, V)`: Calls `minDistance()` to find the vertex `u` with the smallest distance that is not yet included in the SPT.
  - `sptSet[u] = 1`: Marks vertex `u` as processed (included in the SPT).
  - **Step 2**: The inner `for` loop goes through all adjacent vertices `v` of `u`:
    - `graph[u][v]`: Checks if there is an edge from vertex `u` to `v` (non-zero weight).
    - `sptSet[v] == 0`: Ensures that vertex `v` is not already in the SPT.
    - `dist[u] != INT_MAX`: Ensures the current vertex `u` is reachable (its distance is not infinity).
    - `dist[u] + graph[u][v] < dist[v]`: Checks if the path from the source to `v` through `u` offers a shorter distance. If so, updates `dist[v]` to the new shorter distance.
  - After the loop finishes, the shortest distance from the source `src` to the destination `dest` is returned: `return dist[dest]`.

### **4. `main` Function**
```c
int main()
{
    int V, src, dest;

    printf("Enter number of vertices: ");
    scanf("%d", &V);

    int graph[MAX_VERTICES][MAX_VERTICES];

    printf("Enter the adjacency matrix (use 0 for no edge, non-zero for weight of edge):\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < V; j++)
        {
            scanf("%d", &graph[i][j]);
        }
    }

    printf("Enter the source vertex: ");
    scanf("%d", &src);

    printf("Enter the destination vertex: ");
    scanf("%d", &dest);

    int shortestDist = dijkstra(graph, V, src, dest);
    printf("Shortest distance from %d to %d is: %d\n", src, dest, shortestDist);

    return 0;
}
```
- **Purpose**: This is the entry point of the program.
- **Explanation**:
  - `int V, src, dest`: Declares variables for the number of vertices, the source vertex, and the destination vertex.
  - Prompts the user for the number of vertices in the graph and stores it in `V`.
  - The user is then prompted to enter the adjacency matrix, representing the graph's weights. For each edge between vertices `i` and `j`, the weight is stored in `graph[i][j]`.
  - The user is asked to provide the source and destination vertices for which to calculate the shortest path.
  - Calls `dijkstra()` to compute the shortest path and prints the result.

### **Time Complexity Analysis**
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**:
  - The `minDistance()` function is called once for each vertex, and each call scans all `V` vertices to find the vertex with the smallest distance. This takes `O(V)` time.
  - For each vertex, the algorithm processes all other vertices in the inner loop. This takes `O(V)` time for each vertex.
  - Therefore, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is **O(V^2)**. This complexity is acceptable for graphs with a moderate number of vertices (e.g., up to 1000).

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is determined by the storage of the `dist[]` and `sptSet[]` arrays, each of size `O(V)`.
  - Thus, the space complexity is **O(V)**.

### **Conclusion**
This program efficiently calculates the shortest path between a source and destination vertex using **Dijkstra's Algorithm**. The graph is represented by an adjacency matrix, and the program finds the shortest path using a greedy approach that repeatedly selects the vertex with the minimum known distance. 

The **time complexity** of the algorithm is **O(V^2)**, and the **space complexity** is **O(V)**, where `V` is the number of vertices in the graph. This implementation works well for small to medium-sized graphs. For large graphs, more efficient implementations of Dijkstra's Algorithm using priority queues (such as binary heaps) can improve the time complexity to **O((V + E) log V)**, where `E` is the number
